            Hello! I am Hassan. I have finished recently an Full Stack Bootcamp
            and looking for my first position as a Full Stack Developer.
            Technologies I learned is MERN(MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and
            NodeJS). I create responsive websites that are displayed on all
            devices desktops and smartphones. Of course, before I begin
            developing any webapp, Landing Page, Business Website or E-commerce,
            I need to have a ready-made project layout (sketch). Iâ€™m ready to
            learn more everyday and looking for improve and show my skills.
